## Introduction
Hi! I'm a system analyst, researcher and a rather obsessive diagram‑maker. I enjoy hunting for information and then structuring it into something clear and workable.

I'm a bit like GPT, but I function on fragmentary technical inputs - and far, far slower. Once I gather enough ibformaion, I usually see how a system could be designed, what features it might require, and how its internal logic should behave. When the idea is settled, I can produce technical and functional specifications, interface prototypes, structured reports and even custom journey and value maps.

I was fortunate to contribute to projects across several R&D domains:
- Multibeam sonar systems
- Doppler Velocity Log (DVL)
- Synthetic aperture sonar
- Quantum key distribution system
- Agrotech carbon‑sequestration MRV platform (ongoing, long‑term PET project)

## My Professional Skills
- Reverse engineering of analogue products and prototypes, including analysis of user guides, datasheets, software packages, publications and patents . Can also include market and product‑level comparative research.
- Decomposition of a Technical Specification into independent functional modules. This covers analytical breakdown, identification of scope boundaries, formulation of sub‑requirements and clarification of implicit assumptions.
- Visualisation of structures, behaviours and processes through formal diagrams: sequence diagrams, state diagrams, block diagrams, activity diagrams, timing diagram
- Design of information‑exchange protocols: defining session initiation, acknowledgement logic, data integrity checks, payload structure, semantic meaning of parameters, and error‑handling rules for communication between devices.
- Design of data‑storage architecture, including database schema development and definition of relationships, constraints and data flows
- Software prototyping: interface mockups, visualisation of feature sets, and development of minimal functional prototypes (with emulated inputs where necessary).
- Preparation of technical presentation materials for ongoing R&D projects (concept summaries, system overviews, architecture visuals, research findings).

## My Technical knowledge
### Basic
- Basic principles of STM, HDL (VHDL / SystemVerilog) and digital logic design
- Understanding of interfaces: RS‑232/485, SPI, I²C, LVDS, Ethernet
- Ability to read and interpret electrical schematics (Altium Designer)
- Basic understanding of mechanical drawings and enclosure design constraints
- IoT concepts: sensors, data acquisition, serial communication, low‑power devices
- Basics of User Interface development (Django, React, Matlab UI and even QT Creator)


### Specials (sonars)
- Basic knowledge of underwater acoustic communication protocols (Evologic, Teledyne, XBlue, Nortek, Hyscan proprietary formats)
- Reverse engineering and system-level analysis of hydrographic software suites (QPS QINSy, HYPACK / HYSWEEP)
- Understanding of International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) standards
- Basics of sonar array design and acoustic signal processing (MATLAB)

  
 ### Specials (QKD)
- Basic principles of time‑bin BB84 QKD
- Understanding of synchronization standards: IEEE 1588‑2008, Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE)
- Familiarity with Russian cryptographic compliance requirements
 ### Specials (Climate change)
- IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (selected sections)
- ISO 14064 (GHG accounting)
- National MRV standards (Order of the Ministry of Natural Resources of the Russian Federation)
- GSOC MRV Protocol CB0509EN
- Basic principles of NDIR CO₂ gas‑measurement sensors
- Basic understanding of PP Systems EGM‑5 portable gas analyzer

  
 ### The instruments I use 
- Draw.io (primary tool for system diagrams and process visualisation)
- Figma (in case of collaboration)
- Gitlab (project structuring, tasks managing, version control)
- React (for functional UI prototypes and architecture exploration)
- PostgreSQL / PostGIS (as a user and schema designer)
- MATLAB  (for modelling, signal analysis)
- Vivado (for understanding and testing digital logic designs)
- QGIS (for spatial data inspection and environmental datasets)
- Google Docs, Sheets, Slides (documentation, specifications, technical reports)
- GPT OpenAI (for ideation, text structuring, rapid drafting and exploration of technical approaches)
